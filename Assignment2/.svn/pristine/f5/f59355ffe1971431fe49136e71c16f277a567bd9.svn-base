//Add your program1.cpp code to this file

//Near the top, add an include to "ShaderManager.h"

//Replace the shader setup calls with
//calls to ShaderManager methods. See
//the program1-shaderManager.cpp example
//on the course webpage.

//You can then remove the functions:
//printProgramLinkLog()
//printProgramCompileLog()
